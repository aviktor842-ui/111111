          Below is one in-depth guide plus two quick reads. Each post is designed to answer a real decision you have to
          make when buying or using <strong>noise cancelling headphones</strong>: how ANC actually behaves, whether a model is
          comfortable after two hours, and how to get better results without spending more.
        </p>

        <article class="mb-5">
          <h3>Active Noise Cancellation Explained: What You Really Hear</h3>
          <p>
            Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works best on steady, low-frequency sounds: engine hum, air conditioning, bus and
            train rumble. A microphone listens to the noise, the headphone creates an “inverse” signal, and your ear receives
            less of that noise. That sounds simple, but real rooms are messy. Voices, keyboard clicks, and sudden claps change
            too quickly for perfect cancellation—so even excellent ANC often <em>reduces</em> chatter rather than removing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s why fit matters almost as much as processing. A good seal lets ANC focus on the frequencies it can cancel,
            while passive isolation blocks higher frequencies. If you wear glasses, have long hair under the ear cup, or use
            worn earpads, you may lose the seal and feel like the noise cancelling “isn’t working.” In that case, replacing
            pads or adjusting the headband can make a bigger difference than changing brands.
          </p>
          <p>
            When comparing models, look beyond headline claims. Battery ratings are often measured at moderate volume, and
            microphone quality can vary dramatically between quiet rooms and windy streets. If calls matter, pick a model with
            strong noise reduction on the mic, not just on playback.

            For independent measurement terminology, RTINGS’ ANC test explanations are a helpful reference
            (<a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/tests/isolation/noise-isolation-cancellation-passive-active" target="_blank" rel="noopener">external link</a>).

        <h2>Quick reads</h2>
        <h3>1) Comfort checklist for long study sessions</h3>
        <p>
          Start with clamp force and ear-cup depth. If your ears touch the driver cover, you’ll feel pressure after an hour.
          Lightweight frames, softer pads, and a stable headband matter more than extra codec options for most students.
        </p>

        <h3>2) Travel setup: ANC + earplugs + a good playlist</h3>
        <p>
          For long flights, ANC reduces fatigue, but pairing it with low-profile earplugs during sleep can improve comfort.
          Keep volume moderate; the goal is to hear details, not overpower noise.
